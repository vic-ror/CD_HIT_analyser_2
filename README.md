# CD_HIT_analyser_2
Repository to store a Python algorithm for analyzing cd-hit output data, works for both amino acids (CD-HIT) and nucleotides (CD-HIT-EST)

#Features:
* Automates the relationship between font size and identity degree
* Works for both amino acid and nucleotide sequences

Automation of data information:
* Largest cluster
* Smallest cluster
* Average number of sequences in clusters
* Median number of sequences in clusters
* Information about clusters with only 1 sequence


Analysis of the relationship between clusters based on identifiers X, Y, etc.
* Number of clusters shared between identifiers (e.g., X and Y)
* Number of clusters exclusive to a certain identifier (X or Y)
* e.g. How many and which clusters have sequence of both sample X and sample Y, and how many and which are unique to each.
NOTE: It works with up to 5 identifiers.
